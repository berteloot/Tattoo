## Deployment Notes

### Production Considerations

3. **Performance**: Widget loads asynchronously, minimal impact on page load
4. **SEO**: Widget content is not indexed by search engines

### Monitoring
- Track widget load success rates
- Monitor booking conversion rates
- Check for broken Calendly URLs
