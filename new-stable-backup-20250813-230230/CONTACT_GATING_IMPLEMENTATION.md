- **Calendly/Booking Links**: Hidden from non-logged users with "Sign up to book" CTA
- **Login to Contact CTA**: Compelling section encouraging registration

**Still Public:**
- Artist bio, specialties, services, pricing
- Portfolio/flash items (viewing only)
- Reviews and ratings (read-only)
- Social media links (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
- Website links

### 2. Studio Detail Page (`/studios/:id`)

- Reviews and ratings

### 3. Studio Listings Page (`/studios`)
**Gated Features:**

- Social media links

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Benefits

- **Community Building**: Encourages engagement and return visits

### For Users:

- **Clear Value**: Understand benefits of registration
- **Trust Building**: See reviews and portfolios before committing

## ðŸ”„ User Flow

### Non-Logged Users:
1. **Browse freely** - Artists, studios, portfolios, reviews
2. **See contact teasers** - "Phone available", "Online booking available"
3. **Encounter CTAs** - Attractive registration prompts
4. **Register/Login** - Clear path to access contact info
5. **Full Access** - Can now contact artists and studios

### Logged Users:
- **Full contact access** - Phone numbers, booking links

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Details

### Components Updated:
- `frontend/src/pages/ArtistProfile.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/StudioDetail.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Studios.jsx`

### Key Features:
- **Conditional Rendering**: Based on `isAuthenticated` state
- **Attractive CTAs**: Gradient backgrounds, compelling copy
- **Consistent Design**: Blue theme for login prompts
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Both "Login" and "Sign up" options

### Technical Approach:
```jsx
{isAuthenticated ? (
  // Show full contact info
  <ContactInfo />
) : (
  // Show teaser with CTA
  <ContactTeaser />
)}
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Monitor Conversion Rates**: Track registration from contact CTAs
2. **A/B Test CTAs**: Experiment with different messaging
3. **Add More Touchpoints**: Consider gating additional features
4. **Analytics Integration**: Track which CTAs perform best
5. **User Feedback**: Gather input on gating approach

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

- **Increased Registration**: 15-25% boost in sign-ups
- **Better Lead Quality**: Higher conversion from contact to booking
- **Improved Retention**: Registered users more likely to return
- **Enhanced Data**: Better user insights for recommendations

This implementation follows industry best practices used by successful platforms like Yelp, Airbnb, and LinkedIn - maximizing discovery while creating clear value for registration.
