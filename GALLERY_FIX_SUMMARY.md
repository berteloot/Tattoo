## 📋 How to Use Gallery

### For Artists
1. **Login** with your artist account
2. **Ensure you have an artist profile** (create one if needed)
3. **Navigate to Artist Dashboard**
4. **Upload gallery items** with proper authentication

### For Clients
1. **Browse gallery items** (public access)
2. **View artist portfolios** (no authentication required)
3. **Contact artists** through the platform

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User logs in → Gets JWT token
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Token sent with gallery requests
4. Backend validates token and role
5. Artist profile verified
6. Gallery upload allowed
```

### Required Permissions
- **User Role**: ARTIST or ARTIST_ADMIN
- **Artist Profile**: Must exist and be verified
- **Authentication**: Valid JWT token required
- **Form Data**: Proper multipart/form-data format

### Error Scenarios Handled
- ❌ **Not logged in** → "Please log in"
- ❌ **Wrong role** → "Only artists can upload"
- ❌ **No artist profile** → "Please create artist profile"
- ❌ **Invalid data** → Shows specific validation errors
- ❌ **Server error** → "Please try again later"

## 🔍 Browser Extension Errors

The browser extension errors you're seeing are **NOT related to your application**:
- `content-script.js` errors → Chrome extensions
- `inject.bundle.js` errors → Browser developer tools
- `WebSocket connection failed` → Development tools

**These can be safely ignored** as they don't affect your app's functionality.

## 📱 Testing the Fix

### Test Account Created
- **Email**: test-artist-gallery@example.com
- **Password**: test123456

### To Test Gallery Upload
1. Register as an artist or use existing artist account
2. Verify email address
3. Create artist profile
4. Try uploading a gallery item

## 🔗 Next Steps
